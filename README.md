# Magnetic dipole coupled oscillators - M.D.C.O

In this project we analyze coupled Oscillating magnets modeled as dipoles on rods, as in the following sketch:

In this system there are 3 thin cylindrical magnets of radius $R$ and of equal strengths $\left|\vec{m}_ {1}\right|=\left|\vec{m}_ {3}\right|=\left|\vec{m}_{3}\right|$. One is stationary in the middle and the other two can freely rotate around their point of contact with the ground.
In order to tackle this problem we will use a few simplifying assumptions:
1. The magnets can be modeled as their magnetic dipole moment connected to the point of contact by a massles rod of radius $R$.
2. Air resistance is completely neglegible.

Before we jumped into solving this intimidating problem, we solved a similar one as can be be seen in this sketch:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec266417-e2bf-48ee-bb52-1f1216fc7240)

as you can see this system avoids the effect of gravity by making the magnets rotate around their center and thus we can trivially conclude that $pi^\circ$ is the angle of stability (0 is an unstable equilibrium). This system also makes the magnetic field calculations a lot simpler.
You can see this system simulated in time at this [link](https://alon-h.github.io/dipole-oscillations/) or you could <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> $\to$ <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> the sketch.js file into the [online p5js editor](https://editor.p5js.org) and edit the values yourself.

## Theoretical Results

We will use Lagrangian mechanics to solve this problem theoretically. We will first write the Lagrangian for the simplest system. The total magnetic energy stored in the system is given by $U = U_{12} + U_{13} + U_{23}$ where 

$$
U_{ij} = -\vec{m_{i}} \cdot \vec{B_{j}}, \quad \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\left(3\hat{r}\left(\vec{m}\cdot\hat{r}\right) - \vec{m}\right)
$$

Those can be found to be:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
U_{12} = \frac{\mu_{0} m^{2} \cos \theta_{1}}{4\pi d^{3}}, & U_{13} = \frac{\mu_{0} m^{2} \cos \theta_{2}}{4\pi d^{3}}, & U_{23} = \frac{\mu_{0} m^{2}}{32\pi d^{3}}\left(2\sin \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2} + \cos \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}\right)
\end{array}
$$

At this point we can define $a=\frac{\mu_0 m^{2}}{4\pi d^{3}}$ in order to remove unneccesary parameters. Thus the corresponding Lagrangian is

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} I \left(\dot{\theta}_ {1}^{2} + \dot{\theta}_ {2}^{2}\right) - \frac{a}{8}\left[8\left(\cos \theta_{1} + \cos \theta_{2}\right) +2\sin\theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2} + \cos \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}\right]
$$

In order to get the two normal modes for small oscillations around $\pi$ (the stable point), we need to use small angle approximations, yielding

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} I \left(\dot{\theta}_ {1}^{2} + \dot{\theta}_ {2}^{2}\right) + \frac{a}{8}\left[\frac{9}{2}\left(\theta_{1}^{2} + \theta_{2}^{2}\right)-
2\theta_{1} \theta_{2}\right]
$$

From here we can conclude the two normal modes are

$\omega_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{7a}{I}}, \quad \vec{v_{1}}=(1,-1)$ <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff84db35-8c2c-42e5-9ef5-d929bf890041" width="140" height="80"/>

$\omega_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{11a}{I}}, \quad \vec{v_{2}}=(1,1)$  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef8c0452-ec58-4c26-a3d2-f0ff3b3cc439" width="140" height="80"/>


Now we can express every oscillation as $(\theta_1(t),\theta_2(t)) = A \vec{v_1} \sin(\omega_1 t + \varphi_1) + B \vec{v_2} \sin(\omega_2 t + \varphi_1)$. if we start an oscillation by giving just one magnet spin its equivalant to the boundary conditions $(\theta_1(0),\theta_2(0)) = (0,0), \\ (\dot{\theta_1}(0),\dot{\theta_2}(0))=(\omega_0,0)$ from those we can get the expected solution:

$$ \left(\begin{array}{c}
\theta_1\left(t\right)\\
\theta_2\left(t\right)
\end{array}\right)= \frac{\omega_0}{2\omega_1 \omega_2} \left(\begin{array}{c}
\omega_1 \sin(\omega_2 t) + \omega_2 \sin(\omega_1 t)\\
\omega_1 \sin(\omega_2 t) - \omega_2 \sin(\omega_1 t)
\end{array}\right)$$

and from the simulation we can confirm this solution:

On the next step we added mass onto the side of the magnet as can be seen here. this was in order to find the frequencies around a non-zero point

The solution proccess was simillar as in the previus step, We found the lagrangian, Approximated it around $\theta=\alpha$ and used EL to find the linear ODE for $\theta_1$. we also defined $b=MgR$

$$ I\frac{d^{2}\theta_{1}}{dt^{2}}=-\theta_{1}\left(a\\ \cos\left(\alpha\right)+\frac{a}{8}\sin\left(\alpha\right)^{2}+\frac{a}{8}+b\sin\left(\alpha\right)\right)+\theta_{2}\left(\frac{a}{4}-\frac{a}{8}\sin\left(\alpha\right)^{2}\right)+a\\ \sin\left(\alpha\right)\left(\frac{\cos\left(\alpha\right)}{8}-1\right)+b\cos\left(\alpha\right)$$

Firstly we know that if $\alpha$ is an equilibrium then $\frac{d^{2}\theta_{1}}{dt^{2}}\mid_{\theta_1=\theta_2=0} = 0 \to \tan\left(\alpha\right)\left(\frac{\cos\left(\alpha\right)}{8}-1\right)=-\frac{b}{a} \to \alpha \approx \arctan\frac{b}{a}$

From the ODE we can find the normal modes' frequencies

$$\omega_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{a\cos\left(\alpha\right)+\frac{a}{4}\sin\left(\alpha\right)^{2}-\frac{a}{8}+b\sin\left(\alpha\right)}{I}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}+\frac{a}{8}\frac{b^{2}-a^{2}}{b^{2}+a^{2}}}{I}}\$$

$$\omega_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{a\cos\left(\alpha\right)+\frac{3}{8}a+b\sin\left(\alpha\right)}{I}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}+\frac{3}{8}a}{I}} $$
